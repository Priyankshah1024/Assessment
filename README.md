<p> I would like to bring to your attention an issue I encountered with ScheduleViewModel.dart in this app. </p>
<p> In Clicking "Go to Schedule" in HomeView.dart opens Create Schedule automatically, showing the "Select Date" calendar without clicking. Additionally, I'm getting the error "debuglocked!=true" in ScheduleViewModel.dart. </p>
<p> After careful consideration and I have decided to redirect to the ScheduleScreenViewModel.dart. </p>
<p> I am confident that this adjustment will address the problem and contribute to the overall success of the project. </p>

<h5> Thank you. </h5>
